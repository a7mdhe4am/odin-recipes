            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
             Full of flavor with a hint of sweetness,
             this moist and delicious salmon is ready in under 10 minutes!
             You may want to add salt before serving if you are using an unsalted Cajun seasoning.
             I like to use a Misto sprayer with my own oil,
             but feel free to use regular cooking spray.
             For best results,
             use center-cut fillets that are about an inch thick.
            </p>
