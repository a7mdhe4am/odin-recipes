        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Cacio e pepe is a pasta dish from the cuisine of the city of Rome.
               Cacio e pepe means "cheese and pepper" in several central Italian dialects.
               As the name suggests, the ingredients of the dish are: black pepper, grated Pecorino Romano cheese, and spaghetti, or traditionally tonnarelli.
               All the ingredients keep well for a long time, which made the dish practical for shepherds without fixed abode.
               Rough-surfaced pasta is recommended, to make the sauce adhere well.</p>
            
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 ¾ cups grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 minutes. Scoop out some of the cooking water and reserve. Drain spaghetti.

            </li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and pepper; cook and stir until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add spaghetti and Pecorino Romano cheese. Ladle in 1/2 cup of reserved cooking water; stir until cheese is melted, about 1 minute. Add more cooking water until sauce coats spaghetti, about 1 minute more.</li>
